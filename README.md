# Github User Finder

## ✅ Goal
To create a react app to search github user

## ✅ Tech stack!
	* React
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * Javascript

## ✅ What does it do? 
It searches for all the Github users using the text inputted by the user in the form. It returns all the users matching the string in a grid format. Clicking on the more tab takes the user to a custom made page with the vital stats.

## ✅ Features
1. It searches for user profiles as you type but reduces unnecessary API calls using setTimeout() method. So API is only called when you have stopped typing your desired keyword.
2. It shows the user information like number of repos, gists, followers and following.
3. It fetches the 5 latest added repos with stars, watchers and forks.
4. User's profile and repo are directly linked to GitHub, so anyone searching on this platform would easily be able to navigate to user's GitHub profiles.
5. It takes care of all the edge cases for the API info returned.
6. It is Mobile Responsive. It's 2019 and That's not a feature anymore. :)
